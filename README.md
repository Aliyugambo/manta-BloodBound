## 1. Problem Statement  

Across developing regions, access to timely and compatible blood donations remains a major healthcare challenge.  
Patients often face delays in finding donors with matching blood types, hospitals struggle with underutilized donor data, and existing donation systems are fragmented and largely offline.  

### Key Problems Identified:
- Inefficient blood request & matching process.  
- Limited collaboration between hospitals.  
- Unverified donors create safety risks.  
- Poor visibility into available donors and donation frequency.  

> **Summary:**  
> The gap between willing donors and patients in need remains wide — not because of scarcity, but due to a lack of coordination and verification.
